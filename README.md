# Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/expanded-notation.html).

## Part 1

```
expanded_form(12)  # Should return '10 + 2'
expanded_form(42)  # Should return '40 + 2'
expanded_form(70304)  # Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
```

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.

## Part 2

```
expanded_from(807.304)  # Should return "800 + 7 + 3/10 + 4/1000"
expanded_from(1.24)  # Should return "1 + 2/10 + 4/100"
expanded_from(7.304)  # Should return "7 + 3/10 + 4/1000"
expanded_from(0.04)  # Should return "4/100"
```
